Very similar to JS Fiddle 
You will see that there are four panes - three are for editing HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you will enter code into each of these .
Fotr the final output you need to hit the "RUN" button on the right hand side corner.

The final pane “Result” is where jsFiddle creates a page from your code.

At the top of the screen are buttons for managing the Fiddle, and on the left hand side are more detailed settings for the Fiddle.
